Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project you will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

To meet specifications in the project, take a look at the requirements in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view)

How To Set Up Project
---

**Step 1:** Setup Python

Python 3 is needed. Python packages that you will use include numpy, matplotlib, OpenCV and moviepy. Jupyter notebook will be used to build the lane line detection application.

Choose **[Python 3 Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)** install package for your operating system. Download and install it.

~~~bash
conda create --name={environment-name} python=3 
source activate {environment-name}
~~~

**Step 2:** Installing OpenCV

~~~bash
pip install msgpack
pip install opencv-contrib-python
~~~

**Step 3:** Installing moviepy

~~~bash
pip install moviepy
~~~

**Step 4:** Opening the project in Jupyter Notebook

~~~bash
jupyter notebook
~~~
